## Bachelor's Degree

First, I accept that it is not my better work, but in my defense, I was learning. After the early years of the Bachelor's Degree in computer science, the course was directed to embedded systems, which was the focus of my studies.

A thesis is required to get the Bachelor's Degree, and I submitted in support of candidature the follow [document](https://github.com/ugliara-fellipe/bachelor-s-degree/raw/main/thesis.pdf). In mid-2010, the agricultural sensing using wireless sensor networks was between the research trends in the universities with focus on agriculture courses, in the countryside federal university that I studied wasn't different.

I didn't know but that this research was my first contact with the research area that real catching me, programming languages. I had luck, [TinyOS](https://github.com/tinyos/tinyos-main) was written in [nesC](http://nescc.sourceforge.net/) a language designed to respect the hardware limits of sensor nodes.

The language nesC was defined to allow the development of the software in components. The studies of nesC opened my eyes to the universe of the no less important but programming languages less disclosed. You could think that I am crazy spending my time with these forgotten languages, but if you look with cation you see interesting ideas that can be moved to the so modern languages used today.
